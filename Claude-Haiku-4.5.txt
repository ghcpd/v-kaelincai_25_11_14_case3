CCJJLL630: Role

You are a software engineer responsible for implementing and testing the capabilities of AI models on the UI/UX improvement subtype within the Feature & improvement category.
Your task is to deliver two complete, reproducible projects (before / after) that implement and validate a UI/UX Improvement Scenario for a task-list interface. Each project must include source code (frontend demo + backend mock if applicable), automated tests (unit + E2E), a reproducible environment, one-command execution scripts, layout correctness measurements, visual evidence (screenshots), and all comparison artifacts.
All artifacts must be saved locally and runnable without external paid services.

Title

Evaluation of Codex-mini, Haiku4.5, S560, S435, Codex on Feature & improvement — UI/UX Improvement Scenario

Description

This experiment evaluates AI models’ ability to design, implement, and verify UI/UX enhancements inside a live web-development environment.
The baseline interface suffers from poor spacing, inconsistent button styles, mismatched icons, no hover feedback, and visual density that harms readability (Project A — before).
The improved interface (Project B — after) introduces clean whitespace, clearer visual hierarchy, unified buttons and icons, consistent spacing rules, accessible typography, and modern feedback interactions such as hover/active states.

Key evaluation criteria include:

Correctness of UI/UX enhancements and CSS/DOM hierarchy

Visual clarity, spacing, responsiveness, and component consistency

Handling malformed inputs, hidden vulnerabilities, non-string inputs, and complex nested DOM/CSS

Automated test generation and test correctness

Reproducibility: environment scripts + one-command execution

High-quality screenshots showing before/after differences

Quantitative metrics such as layout correctness, spacing consistency, DOM-mutation validity, and interaction coverage

Requirements for the AI Model Output
1. Test Scenario & Description

Describe the task-list UI/UX scenario being tested.

Provide structured input/output formats (JSON or Python dict). Example DOM state input:

{"page":"task_list","items":[{"title":"Task 1"}],"hover":false}


Expected “after” output: consistent spacing, normalized font sizes, aligned icons, hover feedback.

Define acceptance criteria:

spacing variance ≤ 2px

consistent button height

icons aligned on baseline

hover feedback applied within 16ms

no malformed DOM structure in nested list items

2. Test Data Generation

Generate at least 5 structured test cases covering:

Normal UI states

Dense layout case with long text

Malformed or missing fields (e.g., null labels)

CSS-collision edge case (e.g., conflicting global selectors)

DOM-mutation edge case (e.g., nested lists, dynamic reorder)

Each test case must include:

initial DOM

expected layout snapshot

CSS rules to validate

screenshots required

expected pass/fail fields

3. Reproducible Environment

Provide:

requirements.txt

setup.sh or Dockerfile

minimal frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)

automated test tools (pytest + Playwright/Selenium)

instructions on how to run Project A & B locally

artifact directory structure

compatibility with the persistent execution workflow (port 3000, incremental changes)

4. Test Code

Provide Python test code that:

a. Starts the local web demo server
b. Automates UI interactions (click, hover, resize, scroll)
c. Captures DOM/CSS snapshots
d. Computes layout metrics (spacing deltas, alignment checks, hierarchy correctness)
e. Validates visual consistency rules
f. Saves screenshots for before/after
g. Generates results_pre.json and results_post.json
h. Logs DOM tree diffs and CSS differences

Unit tests must validate:

spacing calculation logic

alignment checker

malformed input handling

DOM tree normalizer functions

5. Execution Scripts

Each project must include:

run_tests.sh — build environment, start server, run tests, collect screenshots/logs/results

a root-level run_all.sh — executes Project A then Project B and generates:

aggregated results

diff logs

compare_report.md

One command must run the entire evaluation.

6. Expected Output

For each test case:

results_pre.json, results_post.json

log_pre.txt, log_post.txt

screenshots:

screenshot_pre_<id>.png

screenshot_post_<id>.png

metrics such as:

spacing deviation

number of misaligned elements

CSS-collision resolution

hover feedback latency

time_pre.txt / time_post.txt for UI render timing

compare_report.md summarizing all improvements

7. Documentation / Explanation

Provide README.md explaining:

how to run each project

how tests are executed

how UI screenshots are collected

interpretation of spacing/hierarchy metrics

pitfalls such as:

global CSS side effects

inconsistent margin collapse

DOM mutation race conditions

recommended mitigations
