# UI/UX Improvement Evaluation Projects (Before & After)

This workspace contains two projects demonstrating a UI/UX improvement: Project_A_BeforeUI (baseline) and Project_B_AfterUI (improved). Each project includes a minimal Flask app, CSS/JS, unit and end-to-end tests using pytest and Playwright, setup and run scripts, and automated evaluation metrics.

See `run_all.sh` to run both projects, generate screenshots, JSON result files, logs, and a final `compare_report.md` summarizing improvements.

Requirements: Python 3.10+, Playwright (browsers), pytest

Use scripts inside each project: `setup.sh` to install dependencies, and `run_tests.sh` to run tests for an individual project.
