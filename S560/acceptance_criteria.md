Acceptance Criteria for UI/UX Evaluation

- Spacing variance (standard deviation of vertical gaps) ≤ 2px in the improved UI (post).
- All buttons should have consistent heights between 30–40px.
- Icons should be aligned on the baseline within 2px of mean Y offset.
- Hover feedback should appear within 16ms in the improved UI or be faster than baseline.
- Nested list items should not contain malformed HTML (no unclosed tags, valid DOM tree) and should render consistently.
